I am a PhD student in the [Systems Research Group](https://dse.in.tum.de/) supervised by [Prof.
Pramod Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/) at the [Technische Universit채t
M체nchen](https://www.tum.de/en/). My primary interests include compilers, programming languages and
operating systems.

## Bio

I completed my Masters thesis in Informatics at the [Technische Universit채t
M체nchen](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/home/), advised by [Sebastian
Reimers](https://sebastian-reimers.github.io/) and supervised by [Prof. Pramod
Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/). My thesis topic was the implementation of an **Arm
backend for a Hybrid Binary Translator (HBT)**.

Prior to that, I was an AI software engineer within the CCG group at Intel Corporation. There, I
worked on the AI model compiler underlying the Intel VPU platform for inference, while also
providing support for customers integrating Intel technology within their own products.

I earned by Bachelor of Engineering from [Universitate Politehnica Timisoara](https://www.upt.ro/)
with a major in Computer Engineering and Information Technology.
